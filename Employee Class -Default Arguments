/*Create a class called Employee in C++. Define the class private data members for storing necessary attributes of Employee such as Eno, name, designation, age, etc., Define necessary member functions to read and print the attributes. Define a public member function calculateGross() and overload it in the following manner.

1) calculateGross(basic): If only basic salary is provided as argument, calculate the gross salary as basic+5000.

 2) calculateGross(basic, HRA): If basic and HRA are provided as arguments, calculate the gross salary as basic+5000+HRA

 3) calculateGross(basic, HRA, DA): If basic, HRA and DA are provided as arguments, calculate the gross salary as basic+5000+DA+HRA

4) calculateGross(basic, HRA, DA,TA): If basic, HRA, DA and TA are provided as arguments, calculate the gross salary as basic+5000+DA+HRA+TA.

5) calculateGross(basic, HRA, DA,TA,PF): If basic, HRA, DA and TA are provided as arguments, calculate the gross salary as basic+5000+DA+HRA+TA-PF.

Define the main function and call all the member functions by providing necessary arguments.*/
