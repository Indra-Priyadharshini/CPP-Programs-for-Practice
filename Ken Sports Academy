/*Ken sports academy conducts summer coaching classes every year on sports like cricket, badminton, swimming, skating,â€¦. 
They plan to collect details of the candidates joining their summer camp with the fields such as name of the candidate, age, game1, hours1, game2, hours2, game3, hours3,
Later they realized that the number of fields are more with no data. Hence they classified it into two classes with the following field set. 
Write a program in C++ to help the organization to maintain the database with relevant base and derived classes.

General - candidateid, name, age, packageamouunt
Customized - candidateid, name, age, no.ofgames, no.ofhours, totalamount */
